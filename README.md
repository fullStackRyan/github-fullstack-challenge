# GITHUB-FULLSTACK-CHALLENGE (WORK IN PROGRESS)

I decided to initial focus on the backend as my most recent role was as a React Developer and I wanted to check how rusty I was with Scala. For me, Scala was going to be the harder part of the challenge. As a consequence, I have not spent much time on the frontend yet, plan to finish it today (12/07/2023)

- When user clicks on a item it takes them to a more details page. Currently it just display username.
